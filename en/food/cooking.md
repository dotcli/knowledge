## Cast-Iron Pan

### Seasoning

0. If it's a 2nd-handed pan, pour __1/2 cup of salt__ into the pan, and scour the surface with paper towel to clean. Then clean with water and dry it off.
1. Set oven to __self-cleaning mode__, put the pan in for __3 hours__.
2. Take pan out to cool, and set oven to __232Â°C__.
3. Fully cover the surface of the pan in an oil high in __unsaturated fat__(usually oils from vegetable, canola, nuts, & seeds). Put the pan back in oven for __30 minutes__.
    - Afterwards, it should look a bit darker than before.
4. Repeat the oil coating -> oven -> cooling process __3 _more_ times__. Afterwards, the pan should look much more deeper black, and much more stick-free. This is due to the layer of polymerized fat and oil from seasoning.

### Maintenance

- It's okay to use soap, and metal utensils on a cast-iron pan, so long as it's seasoned correctly.
- Dry the pan immediately after cleaning. Rust is a big enemy of cast-iron pan. Heat the pan up in oven if you want to dry faster.
- Coat the pan in oil after drying.

### Other things to watch out

Cast-iron pans are very heavy. Make sure the one you choose is comfortable to use for you.

If you are using an electric stove with e.g. glass-top, make sure the bottom of the pan is clean before cooking, remove it off from the stove immediately after cooking, and do not slide the pan on the stove to avoid scratching.


## French Toast

- Use stale or dried bread. Drier bread soaks up the custard better. Challah bread is allegedly amazing too.
- Refresh the cooking oil / butter for every piece of toast. The overcooked bits would burn in the oil and make latter toasts taste bitter.
- The toast will create a lot of bubbles in the oil. When the bubble dies down, it means that side is cooked and it's time to flip.

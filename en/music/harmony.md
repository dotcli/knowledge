Here are some usages of chords I find interesting & inspiring.

#### Lydian chord

Composition: `R 3 (5) 7 #11`. Also written as `Maj7b5`, `Maj7#11`.

It sounds very beautiful when played as IV-Maj7#11 over a major scale. See: The beginning and ending of _One Summer's Day_ from Spirited Away. (`3 4 6 7 (1)` in C major)

The borrowed bVII chord over a major scale can also be voiced with Maj7#11. (`b7 1 2 (4) 6`) [Learn more here](https://youtu.be/yKV58VVGV9k?t=679).

##### Voicing

On Guitar, `Fmaj7b5` is `F A B E`, and  can be played open as `102200`, or `003200` (3rd inversion with E at the base). `1x220x` and `x 8 9 9 10 x` can also be moved up the neck for other maj7b5 chords.

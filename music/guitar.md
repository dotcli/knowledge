## Warm-up routine

The goal of this routine is to stretch muscles, familiarize with the string, and exercise rhythmic sense.

Do the [usual warm-up exercises](https://www.guitarplayer.com/technique/warm-up-time-11-exercises-that-will-help-you-play-even-better) that walk up and down the fretboard; add variations to it \(e.g. alternate finger pattern, skip strings\).

Play through tuplets of different numbers can give you a really solid sense of time. I use a Guitar Pro tab for this exercise. The tab is a 4-4 beat that starts with all quarter notes, then quintuplets\(5\), sextuplets\(6\), septuplet\(7\), 8th notes, and nonuplets\(9\). Then it goes back down, one by one, all the way to quarter notes, and a bit over: triplets, and half notes.

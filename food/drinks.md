### Hot Toddy

This warm cocktail is perfect for winter or cold, rainy days. 

__Scotch whiskey, sugar, lemon, and hot water__ are the basic ingredients. What really makes it shines though are the other spices you could add - __cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, anise__. You can use __honey__ instead of sugar too, or use other warm liquids like tea, coffee, cocoa, etc.

I had the first and best hot toddy at Edinburgh Castle Pub, in San Francisco around 2017. We went out drinking, it started to rain, and I was developing an awful stomach bug. Upon arriving at the pub I asked for "a warm cocktail". The cup of hot toddy elevated the spirit and cured my bug too. She made a garnish with orange peel spiral, and eight cloves stuck into the peel.

### Coffee Tonic

Chill the glass. Pour __tonic water__ in slowly, avoiding bubbling. Add a shot of __cold brew concentrate__. Adjust the acidity with __lemon juice__ if needed.

This drink is perfect for a hot summer afternoon. The tonic water swallows up coffee's bitterness, so that coffee's taste and aroma gets lifted to the surface.

Experiment with different types of tonic water and cold brew. Schweppes tonic water is very acidic already, there's no need to add lemon juice. Avoid muddy cold brew as the particles would make the tonic water lose carbonation.

### Milk Tea

Use __condensed milk__ and __strong tea__. __Honey__ or __lemon juice__ to adjust.

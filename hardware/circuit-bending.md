# Circuit Bending

- Put a resistor in between the wires, so as to avoid burning circuits.
- Have a reset switch that disconnects power source completely. Often those toys keep the power source connected even when you switch off. 
- It is easier to bend older toys, as they would expose more components. Newer ones have their clocks, pitch resistors, etc. all enclosed in the black blob circuitry.
- Only bend battery-powered devices, to avoid frying yourself.

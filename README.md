# Introduction

This is where I document and organize things I know. Hope you find something useful. Common topics are programming, design, and music.

I try to make sure everything documented here are hand-typed and contains somewhat original insights, instead of copy-paste from the net.

For net resources, bookmarks related to each topic, you can find them on the [Memex](https://dotcli.github.io/memex/).

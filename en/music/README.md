### Composition

**Motif**: The smallest possible music idea that can still be recognized as a unique idea. By sticking with motifs throughout the piece, the music stays coherent and with identity.

### Theory

#### Circle of Fifth

When it comes to harmonic analysis, circle of fifth is one of the most important concept to remember.

Try to remember the circular sequence both clockwise and counterclockwise.

C G D A E B Gb Db Ab Eb Bb F C
C F Bb Eb Ab Db Gb B E A D G C
```

When looking at the chord changes in a piece of music, think about their positions on the circle of fifth, and observe how the song "moves" around the circle.

In jazz, harmonics are pushed to its limit, and it makes analysis extra fun. Vox has a [wonderful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62tIvfP9A2w) on John Coltrane's Giant Steps and Circle of Fifth. Speaking of which, here's Coltrane's study of the Circle.

`3x10+2 | 4x8`

This rhythm juxtaposes 2 measures of steady downbeat in 4/4 time, and 10 dotted quarter notes followed by 1 quarter note.

if `1 = sixteenth note`, then the two measures of downbeat adds up to `4x8=32`, and the other rhythm adds up as `3x10+2=32`.

You can count the beats like so:

```
1  4  7  10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31
1   5   9   13  17  21  25  29  
```

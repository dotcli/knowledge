# Introduction
> "Have you tried writing down everything you know about everything?" - @neauoire

This is where I document and organize, well, everything I know. Common topics are programming, design, and music.

I try to keep the contents here somewhat original. Snippets, bookmarks, and quotes from the net can be found over on the [Memex](https://memex.changbai.li/) instead.

Hope you find something helpful.

__Weak AI__: Artificial intelligences that focus on one narrow task. Most existing products that claim themselves to be "AI" are weak AIs. Both Siri and a calculator belongs to this category.

__Strong AI / Artificial General Intelligence__: Artificial intelligences that can solve any intelligent task a human can. Many are researching this field, but as of today it's only existed in science fiction.
> AGI research also looks into Artificial Consciousness, since that's an important of what makes us human. Some define Strong AI as machines that has consciousness.

__Machine Learning__: The technique of training a machine to improve performance of some specific task. Machine learning learns how to better perform a task solely by looking at examples of that task (training data).

__Neural Network__: A computing system vaguely inspired by the network of neurons in our brain. Neural network was better than previous ML frameworks on some fields, such as image recognition & game playing.

## Warm-up routine

Play 2-5-1 progression around the circle of fifth. Do it for major key, and for minor key.

#### Chord Qualities

Major 2-5-1: Minor 7 - Dominant 7 - Major 7

Minor 2-5-1: Half diminished 7 - Dominant 7 - Minor 7

## Solo

Here are some elements to construct a solo. There's a lot more.

### Arpeggio

Add syncopation to create interesting lines, practice connecting arpeggio of different chords, or use them to connect between diatonic lines in two different places.

### Blues

Blues licks can be used as the "backbone" of solo. After going wild with some notes outside the scale, come back to blues licks to "resolve" the tension.

### Patterns

Practice going up and down the scales, using different patterns. When soloing, these patterns can be used to fill between slower, more narrative lines - similar to how arpeggio can be used. Having your fingers get used to these patterns also open up more materials they can put into these lines.

It's also important to make the patterns don't sound so "pattern-y". Too much uniformity gets boring. Add syncopation, and change how the notes are grouped together. i.e. with a 1342 3564 5716 pattern, it's much more interesting when played with triplets like 134 235 645 716...

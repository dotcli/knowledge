### [websocketd](https://github.com/joewalnes/websocketd)

Pros: 

- Very easy to establish a single server-client connection.
- Cross platform af
- UNIX philosophy - do one thing and do it well.
- Can be combined with wide variety of tech.
- Github issue page is well maintained.

Cons:
- Does very little - much harder to use once it's more than single server-client. Have to combine with more tech at that point - which gets complicated.

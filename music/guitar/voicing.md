# Jazz Guitar Chord Voicing

#### LEVEL 0

- Shell Voicing with the root on 5th & 6th string (137 & 173)

There's no 5th note in shell voicing. Therefore we only need Major, Minor, & Dominant.

_Total 12 new shapes._

#### LEVEL 1

- Drop 2 Voicing, using 5432, Root on string 5.
- Drop 3 Voicing, using 6432, Root on string 6.

Each has 4 shapes of Major, Minor, Dominant, and Minor 7b5.
_Total 8 new shapes._

#### LEVEL 2

- Drop 2 Voicing, using 4321, Root on 4 - 4 shapes
- Drop 3 Voicing, using 5321, Root on 5 - 4 shapes

_Total 8 new shapes._

#### LEVEL 3

- Drop 2 Voicing using 4321, all inversions - 3x4 new shapes
- Drop 2 Voicing using 5432, all inversions - 3x4 new shapes

_Total 24 new shapes._

#### LEVEL 4

- Drop 2 Voicing inversions on 6543. 4x4 new shapes (though we don't need the ones that stretch too far)
- Drop 3 Voicing inversions on 6432. 3x4 new shapes
- Drop 3 Voicing inversions on 5321. 3x4 new shapes

_Total ~40 new shapes._

#### NOTE

When you learn a song, vary which string the root is on to practice different shapes.

Playing chord voicing arrangements will teach you shapes in the advanced levels. Playing a ukulele will teach you shapes using 4321 strings.

In addition to those shapes, learn extended chords too. Many of them can substitute 7th chords, while being a lot easier to play.

You can get half diminished chord by moving the upper shape of a major 7th chord (357) down half step. For fully diminished chord, do the same but with a dominant 7th chord (35 b7).

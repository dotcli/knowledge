Learning can only happen from within; no matter how much knowledge the teacher shoves forward, the student can only learn when they want to learn, when they decide to engage the neural processes for acquiring knowledge.

The key to teaching is to _cultivate an environment that encourages learning_.

We must make the learning interesting to the student. Make sure what you are teaching is relevant to them - and if not, show how it can be relevant. Keep them excited to learn, don't be afraid of acting stupid or goofy to make this happen - this is especially effective for children.

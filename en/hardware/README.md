## Battery

### How to tell if a battery is out of juice?

Drop each battery (with the flat, negative end down) from a couple of inches up. If the battery is charged, it should make a solid thud and most likely stay standing. If, however, the battery is dead, it will bounce and fall over immediately.

> This method only works for alkaline batteries. The reason is that as alkaline batteries discharge, they produce hydrogen gas, inflating the battery.

# Pedagogy for guitar and music education

There are usually two goals for any exercise: 1. to get familiar with a new idea, such as call and response; 2. to improve mechanical skill, such as arpeggio and scales.

THe instructions from the teacher must involve exercises targeting one of these two goals.

The common advice of learning licks and improving your "bag" falls somewhere in the middle, and is insufficient by itself. If you do not understand how Charlie Parker constructs his lines, then practicing his licks will only be a slight improvement for the mechanical skill of playing lines similar to Charlie Parker. If you can understand the idea behind his solo, then you'd know where to use the licks and also how to construct similar lines.

Ideas are explanations, too, and follow the rules in _The Beginning of Infinity_ by David Deutsch. Students can come up with those explanations by listening and analysing a piece of music and solo. They can also see them through targeted experiments. If the teacher cannot communicate the idea verbally, then they have a responsibility to provide the students with exercises that bring clarity through experimentation.

Mechanical skills are equally important. Even if the musician can understand the idea, they need to be able to play it. In addition, their mechanical skills may limit the experiments they can do, and thus make it harder for them to discover ideas. For example, I wouldn't be able to understand the role of altered scales over a dominant chord by experimentation, if I can't even find the notes on that scale.

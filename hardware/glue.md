## Glue

### Impact Glue

Also called **Contact Adhesive**, or **Contact Cement**. 万能胶 (all-powerful glue) in Chinese. It can glue together a wide range of materials, including those with smooth surfaces.

#### Usage

1. Spread a layer of this type of glue on *both* surfaces, wait 10-20 minutes for the films to dry.

2. Then, stick them together carefully, making sure the positions are correct at the moment of contact. The surfaces will bond *immediately*.

3. Apply firm pressure briefly to strengthen the bond. No clamps needed.

#### Mechanism

Contact adhesives are typically a solution of natural rubber or neoprene, suspended in water or organic solvents such as acetone. As the solvent evaporate, it leaves behind a layer of rubber, which sticks quickly to the rubber on the opposite surface.

When pressure is applied on this rubber, it undergoes strain crystalization, reordering the chains of molecules making it much tougher, and the bond stronger.

Memex is my public bookmarks, built with [Hamish MacDonald's wonderful tool](https://github.com/kormyen/memex).

Bookmarks in the memex can be filtered by tags, and type of media.

This wiki interacts with the memex; look for the [\#tag](https://dotcli.github.io/memex/#tag-philosophy) links to find bookmarks related to a topic.

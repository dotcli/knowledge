## Cookware

### Cast-Iron Pan

#### Seasoning

0. Clean the dirt & grease. You can use dish soap for the grease. If it's a 2nd-hand pan with uneven seasoning, clean it off by pouring __1/2 cup of salt__ into the pan, and scouring the surface with paper towel to clean. Then clean with water and dry it off.
1. Season the pan by heating oil on the surface to produce a polymer layer. Fully cover the surface of the pan in an oil high in __unsaturated fat__(usually oils from vegetable, canola, nuts, & seeds). Heat the pan till smoking. Wash (do NOT use soap now), heat up to dry off the water, and repeat the coating & heating several times, until the pan looks and feels greasy without adding oil.
2. Now it is seasoned! To tell how well the seasoning was, try frying an egg without oil and see how much it sticks.

#### Usage

You can be more rough when cooking with this utensil: metal utensils are ok to use. If properly seasoned this would be super non-sticky.

#### Maintenance

- Let the pan cool off before washing; Wash it like you would any other utensils.
- Dry the pan immediately after cleaning. Rust is a big enemy of cast-iron pan. Heat the pan up if you want to dry faster.
- Coat the pan in oil after drying. After doing this a few times, the polymer layer will be thick enough that you can skip this step.

#### Other things to watch out

Cast-iron pans are very heavy. Make sure the one you choose is comfortable to use for you.

If you are using an electric stove with e.g. glass-top, make sure the bottom of the pan is clean before cooking, remove it off from the stove immediately after cooking, and do not slide the pan on the stove to avoid scratching.

### Chinese Carbon Steel Wok

The material is quite similar to cast iron, just a lot thinner and lighter. Its light weight, and curved surface makes it perfect for stir frying. It can be seasoned and maintained similar to the cast iron pan.

### Non-sticky pan

Do not use metal utensils on a non-sticky pan, this would destroy the coating.

Always add the oil when pan is _cold_, as heating the pan too hot would destroy the coating.

## Ingredients

### Fat

Always heat butter up gently. Butter is a mixture of things - fat, water, protein. While the fat can withstand high heat, the other components are easier to burn.

Peanut oil is fantastic at high heat cooking.

## French Toast

- Use stale or dried bread. Drier bread soaks up the custard better. 
Baguettes are great because you can cut it into thick small pieces, and really soak up the custard; and the crust adds another layer of texture.
Challah bread is allegedly amazing too.
- Refresh the cooking oil / butter for every round of toasts. The overcooked bits would burn in the oil and make latter toasts taste bitter.
- The toast will create a lot of bubbles in the oil. When the bubble dies down, it means that side is cooked and it's time to flip.

## Shaanxi Chili oil noodle

1. Cook __wide noodle__ in salted water. The noodle should be on the softer side.
2. Take the noodle out into a bowl. Add some __black vinegar__, then put a layer of __crushed red pepper, salt, and minced garlic__.
3. Heat a little bit cooking oil till it smokes. __Peanut oil__ is preferred.
4. Quickly pour the oil evenly on the layer of spices. Stir well and serve.

That's the gist of it. You can also add vegetables on step 2: bean sprouts, leafy greens; add scallion or peanut crumbles; or use soy sauce for the salt. __Sichuan pepper__ is amazing here too, though obviously not for everybody.

So long as there's enough spices in the layer, the oil temperature is high, and the vinegar is unsweetened black vinegar, this dish would be good. The best vinegar for this dish is called 老陈醋 (Mature Vinegar).

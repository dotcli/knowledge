## Vegetarianism

Make sure to consume some of these ingredients when doing vegetarian diet / less meat diet, so that you can get the nutrients without eating much meat.

__Fat__: Diary products, nuts, cooking oils.

__Protein__: Diary products, soy foods, legumes (beans), eggs.

__Zinc__: Dairy products, soy foods, nuts & seeds & legumes.

__Iron__: Beans, soy foods, dark leafy greens.
- Pair with foods rich in vitamin C for better absorpsion.

__Calcium__: Diary products.

__Vitamin D__: Eggs. And sunshine. No really, get outside once in a while!

__Vitamin B12__: Diary products, eggs.

__Omegaâ€“3 Fatty Acids__: Eggs, soy products, (some) nuts & seeds.

For the "semi-vegetarians", who don't refrain completely from eating meat but rather just reduces the amount of consumption, __seafood__ and __animal organs__ can supplement the nutrients lacking in plant-based diet very efficiently - especially for some vitamins, minerals, and essential amino acids.

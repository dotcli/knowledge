Here are some usages of chords I find interesting & inspiring.

#### Lydian chord

Composition: `R 3 (5) 7 #11`. Also written as `Maj7b5`, `Maj7#11`.

It sounds very beautiful when played as IV-Maj7#11 over a major scale. See: The beginning and ending of _One Summer's Day_ from Spirited Away. (`3 4 6 7 (1)` in C major)

The borrowed bVII chord over a major scale can also be voiced with Maj7#11. (`b7 1 2 (4) 6`) [Learn more here](https://youtu.be/yKV58VVGV9k?t=679).

##### Voicing

On Guitar, `Fmaj7b5` is `F A B E`, and  can be played open as `102200`, or `003200` (3rd inversion with E at the base). `1x220x` and `x 8 9 9 10 x` can also be moved up the neck for other maj7b5 chords.

#### Misty Chord

This chord is added in front of the first chord in Misty, used by [Oscar Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiksYdTqGBU) and [explained by Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA-hh5-dLwU).

`D/Eb` to `Ebmaj7`. Or a `VIIb9` to `Imaj7`. It can also be thought of as a `Idim7` resolving to `Imaj7`.

The 7th chord over root can be further flavored as `VII7b9#9` as explained by Adam.

One way to play this chord on guitar, in key of `Eb`, is `11 x 12 11 10 13`. It resolves nicely to `11 x 12 12 11 10`. 

It could also be done lower down the neck at `x 6 7 5 7 x` resolving to `x 6 8 7 8 x`.

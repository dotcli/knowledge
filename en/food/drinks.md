### Hot Toddy

This warm cocktail is perfect for winter or cold, rainy days. 

Scotch whiskey, sugar, lemon, and hot water are the basic ingredients. What really makes it shines though are the other spices you could add - cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, anise. You can use honey instead of sugar too, or use other warm liquids like tea, coffee, cocoa, etc.

I had the first and best hot toddy at Edinburgh Castle Pub, in San Francisco around 2017. We went out drinking, it started to rain, and I was developing an awful stomach bug. Upon arriving at the pub I asked for "a warm cocktail". The cup of hot toddy elevated the spirit and cured my bug too. She made a garnish with orange peel spiral, and eight cloves stuck into the peel.

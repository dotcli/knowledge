# Introduction
> "Have you tried writing down everything you know about everything?" - @neauoire

This is where I document and organize, well, everything I know. Common topics are programming, design, and music.

I try to keep the contents here somewhat original. Snippets, bookmarks, and quotes from the net can be found over on the [Memex](https://memex.changbai.li/) instead.

Hope you find something helpful.

## Building the wiki

This wiki is built with [Gitbook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), and hosted with Github Pages. Check out gitbook's documentation if you want to build your own.
> Note: There are two versions of Gitbook out there, the open source "legacy" Gitbook, and a close-sourced version 2. I'm using the older version since it's a more mature product - the newer one doesn't support multiple languages, for example.

If you see something broken in this wiki, please let me know by submitting an issue [here](http://github.com/dotcli/knowledge/issues).

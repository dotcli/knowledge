## How to find your range

Sing down the scale until you can't go any lower, then sing up the scale until you can't go any higher.

Record these notes:

- the lowest you can go
- the lowest you can comfortably sing
- the highest you can comfortably sing (without forcing your throat to tighten)
- the highest you can sing with your natural voice
- the highest you can sing with falsetto

> If you can't sustain the note, then it doesn't count.

### Range Types

- Bass: F2 to E4
- Baritone: A2 to F4
- Tenor: roughly C3 to A4
- Alto: G3 to E5 (and contralto as F3-D5)
- Mezzo-soprano: A3 to F#5
- Soprano: C4 to A5

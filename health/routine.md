Daily Routine for maintaining a healthy body & mind
========

This is what works for me. It probably won't work for you, since our body is different.

1. Have a diverse diet.
2. Avoid caffeine after 2pm.
3. Take 30 minutes nap when you need it.
4. Avoid late night snack and alcohol to sleep sooner & better.

## Meals and Diets

I avoid following novel diets that require strict adherence to their rules. They usually have severely negative effects when we fall off its requirements, and in practice, we often _need_ to be flexible.

Instead, follow rule-of-thumbs and listen to your body.

- Avoid food that are obviously harmful, such as those from unclean sources.
- Be moderate with food high in sodium, fat, and sugar.
- Adjust diet based on your body's need at the time. For example, in cold weather we need more calorie to stay warm; when building muscles you need to consume more protein.
- Learn to identify your body's signal for when it lacks a certain nutrient, e.g. dry lips when lacking water, nausea for electrolyte imbalance, feeling cold when lacking carbohydrate.

Memex is my public bookmarks, built with [Hamish MacDonald's wonderful tool](https://github.com/kormyen/memex).

Bookmarks in the memex can be filtered by tags, and type of media.

This wiki interacts with the memex; look for the [\#tag](https://memex.changbai.li/#tag-philosophy) links to find bookmarks related to a topic.

## Memex Visualized

By running the memex bookmarks through [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding), we get a visualization of how bookmarks relate to each other.
